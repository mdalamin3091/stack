### Overview

In this project, I aim to create a simple website with a focus on performance, maintainability, and a sleek user interface. To achieve this, I will leverage the Tailwind CSS library for our front-end design. All our API calls will be implemented using Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) and manage the whole website state using the Redux toolkit.

### Key Objectives:

1. Sign-in & Signup page: I will design an engaging and user-friendly sign-in and Signup page using Tailwind CSS.

2. Dashboard: The Dashboard will provide information about the user. I'll leverage Tailwind CSS for components like user table, sidebar, navbar, and interactive elements.

3. API Integration: All data retrieval and management will be handled through RTK Query, ensuring efficient API calls and a smooth user experience. This includes fetching Users and sign-in and signup API.

4. Folder Structure: I'll maintain a well-structured project folder hierarchy to keep our codebase organized and easily maintainable. Components, Redux slices, styles, and utility functions will be neatly organized.

### Technology Stack:

- Language: Typescript
